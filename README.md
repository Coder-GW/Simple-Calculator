# Simple Calculator

I have created this simple calculator to practice solving problems. 
I imagined how it would work and built it from the grould up.

This calculator asks the user to choose an option from addition and substraction among other operations. Depending on the operations, the user will be prompted to input any parameters and then the numbers to be calculated.
This simple calculator will be a stepping stone in creating a more complex calculator in Java

The reason behind using java is that this is a comparably new language for me.
